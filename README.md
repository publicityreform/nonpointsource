# Nonpointsource

These sentences about rivers and cancers draw on personal experiences of cancer treatment and care; the environmental and financial toxicities that precede and accompany illness; and the enduring contaminations that cancer and its treatment produce.

The text is a watershed holding many fragmented and interpolated sources which are cited below. This composition, and accompanying audio, are informed by time spent living and working close to the Hoosic River in rural western Massachusetts, which flows through the ancestral lands of the Mohican, or Muh-he-con-ne-ok: The People of the Waters that are Never Still.

As the primary conduit of runoff from throughout the region, this river is polluted, but not by any single source. “Nonpoint source” pollution is impurity that cannot be traced to a single point of origin—a persistent, ambient pollution; runoff, surging with stormwater, flowing into the river, contaminating the groundwater; thick with petroleum and other chemicals, salts, human and animal waste, fertilizers, pesticides, heavy sand and silt.

The conditions of the living river are our conditions for research: a watery analysis, thinking with bodies as pressurized wet salty things, to better understand conditions of interbeing, entanglement, and porosity—listening intently for nonpoint source pollution: seeping draining runoff and sediment, and how rivers and bodies circulate together.

This hopeful arrangement offers listening perspectives onto the shared imaginary space between rivers and cancers: from above and below water’s surface; where the flow breaks on rocks and debris, where runoff drains into soil and streams; as a chorus of voices, spoken and sung; stories, observations and meditations on the social, political, and ecological entanglements that compose cancer as lived experience.

To listen to rivers in this way is to also problematize the way cancer is understood, as linked to environments and inheritance. Cancers are very rarely attributed to a single cause or factor. They are situational, interconnected, accidental, inevitable.

As Susan Sontag grappled with *Illness as Metaphor*, implicitly analyzing her own cancer experience through the lens of literary material, this text seeks an elucidation of, and liberation from, the metaphors that prejudice common imaginaries surrounding cancer, for patients and caregivers alike.

To an extent, cancer is a common and relatable experience, one that creates and determines community. To an extent, all rivers carry the same water, touching multiple populations and territories in their winding paths. Cancer is both overrepresented and unmentionable (Sontag never writes explicitly about her cancer); some rivers flow clear and drinkable, while many others convey spectral runoff into concrete channels.

This text draws together a braided stream of source texts—illness narratives, scientific publications, and theory work across disciplines—to get at the shared conditions, coherence, and correspondence between rivers and cancers. Direct citation, memory, and observation collage together, as tributaries that flow inwards and spill outwards into oxbow lakes, as tumor strands that in their mutation converge and diverge.

Variations of speech and water, each flowing at a particular place and time, each with their distinctive rhythms, are quoted here as compositional guides: in counterpoint, in mutual support and suspension, as carrier and modulation. This form of word-for-word poetic interpolation is known as a cento, held together in this case as if tentatively laying hands onto the malignancy of a tumor. A tumor cento.

Cancer, along with auto-immune diseases, repeatedly enacts self-destruction within a toxic world—where contaminant is both self and indistinctly other. Cancer is the body, at a scale that is simultaneously personal and globally implicated. This is contamination as collaboration as Anna Tsing writes, where purity is not an option. This exchange of influence between body and world is also a form of survivance—not a reaction by one against the other, but a mutual action, an enduring presence: without collaborations, we all die[^1].
