        These sentences about rivers and cancers draw on personal experiences of
        cancer treatment and care; the environmental and financial toxicities
        that precede and accompany illness; and the enduring contaminations that
        cancer and its treatment produce.
        <br /><br />
        The text is a watershed holding many fragmented and interpolated sources
        which are cited below. This composition, and accompanying audio, are
        informed by time spent living and working close to the Hoosic River in
        rural western Massachusetts, which flows through the ancestral lands of
        the Mohican, or Muh-he-con-ne-ok:
        <em>The People of the Waters that are Never Still</em>. <br /><br />
        As the primary conduit of runoff from throughout the region, this river
        is polluted, but not by any single source. “Nonpoint source” pollution
        is impurity that cannot be traced to a single point of origin—a
        persistent, ambient pollution; runoff, surging with stormwater, flowing
        into the river, contaminating the groundwater; thick with petroleum and
        other chemicals, salts, human and animal waste, fertilizers, pesticides,
        heavy sand and silt.
        <br /><br />
        The conditions of the living river are our conditions for research: a
        watery analysis, thinking with bodies as pressurized wet salty things,
        to better understand conditions of interbeing, entanglement, and
        porosity—listening intently for nonpoint source pollution: seeping
        draining runoff and sediment, and how rivers and bodies circulate
        together.
        <br /><br />
        This hopeful arrangement offers listening perspectives onto the
        shared imaginary space between rivers and cancers: from above and
        below water’s surface; where the flow breaks on rocks and debris, where
        runoff drains into soil and streams; as a chorus of voices, spoken and
        sung; stories, observations and meditations on the social, political, and
        ecological entanglements that compose cancer as lived experience.
        <br /><br />
        To listen to rivers in this way is to also problematize the way cancer
        is understood, as linked to environments and inheritance. Cancers are
        very rarely attributed to a single cause or factor. They are
        situational, interconnected, accidental, inevitable.
        <br /><br />
        As Susan Sontag grappled with <em>Illness as Metaphor</em>, implicitly
        analyzing her own cancer experience through the lens of literary
        material, this text seeks an elucidation of, and liberation from, the
        metaphors that prejudice common imaginaries surrounding cancer, for
        patients and caregivers alike. <br /><br />
        To an extent, cancer is a common and relatable experience, one that
        creates and determines community. To an extent, all rivers carry the
        same water, touching multiple populations and territories in their
        winding paths. Cancer is both overrepresented and unmentionable (Sontag
        never writes explicitly about her cancer); some rivers flow clear and
        drinkable, while many others convey spectral runoff into concrete
        channels.
        <br /><br />
        This text draws together a braided stream of source texts—illness
        narratives, scientific publications, and theory work across
        disciplines—to get at the shared conditions, coherence, and
        correspondence between rivers and cancers. Direct citation, memory, and
        observation collage together, as tributaries that flow inwards and spill
        outwards into oxbow lakes, as tumor strands that in their mutation
        converge and diverge.
        <br /><br />
        Variations of speech and water, each flowing at a particular place and
        time, each with their distinctive rhythms, are quoted here as
        compositional guides: in counterpoint, in mutual support and suspension,
        as carrier and modulation. This form of word-for-word poetic
        interpolation is known as a cento, held together in this case as if
        tentatively laying hands onto the malignancy of a tumor.
        <em>A tumor cento</em>. <br /><br />
        Cancer, along with auto-immune diseases, repeatedly enacts
        self-destruction within a toxic world—where contaminant is both self and
        indistinctly other. Cancer is the body, at a scale that is
        simultaneously personal and globally implicated. This is
        <em>contamination as collaboration</em> as Anna Tsing writes, where
        purity is not an option. This exchange of influence between body and
        world is also a form of <em>survivance</em>—not a reaction by one
        against the other, but a mutual action, an enduring presence:
        <em>without collaborations, we all die</em><sup>1</sup>. <br /><br />

            The exhausted live as fluidly as the water. Our planet neither gains
            nor relinquishes the water it harbors but only witnesses its
            continual reorganization, redistribution and relocation. Rivers and
            cancers are seen as dead or alive depending on causes and
            conditions.

            To call myself a survivor still feels like a betrayal of the dead.
            The wells, streams, and fountains simultaneously polluted, the great
            orbs of the unsaid continue to float through the air river at dawn
            tasting the green silence. But it is time for a new problem. I feel
            like another woman de-chrysalized and become a broader,
            stretched-out me: she has glimpsed the other bank and knows that the
            light plays tricks on you.

            Especially over water and it's hard to tell just how far away the
            other bank is and whether the undertow is carrying you there or back
            or whether the earth you thought was solid is in fact moving. Just
            as rivers in the desert create an abrupt shift from lush to sparse,
            mesic to xeric. Along the banks and in the drylands, riparian and
            dry-adapted. I could die of difference or live myriad selves. Anyone
            who has been half dead can attest to this. Just as those who drink
            water know whether it is hot or cold.

            mutations, genetic and epigenetic alterations; the interconnections
            between tributaries of the river.

            Imagine holding a translucent jellyfish under each of your armpits:
            as you breathe in, their membranes close inwards to form a
            tightening circle; as you breathe out they dilate wide open, ever
            more expansive than before.

            These moments and locations of illness are as natural as our
            fragile, resilient human bodies interacting with the world, all the
            veins in our bodies extended to rivers, intertwined, mangled. Allow
            rain to do what it did before buildings, roads, driveways, parking
            lots, and other impervious surfaces covered the landscape: soak into
            the earth, fill the soil, recharge groundwater, release flow
            gradually to rivers and streams.

            The concept of disease is never innocent, it is invariably an
            encouragement to simplify what is complex. Where is your source?
            Where have you drawn what flows out of you? For me, ebb and flow
            have always set the rhythm of time. One moment is worth absolutely
            no more than the other. Multiple in the unwinding of its becoming,
            robbed of all capacities of self-transcendence, humiliated by fear
            and agony, I hate pollution and I love my body.

            While the individual body might seek to bracket, subdue, or tame
            these channels and flows, this communal body can not live without
            them. A fluid, responsive process, restoration requires digging into
            the past, stretching toward the future, working hard in the present.
            The movement of rivers and cancers hold the was, is, and yet-to-come
            together; the flow and flush; immense slothfulness, like frostbite;
            sedimentation; the saliva in my mouth that enables me to speak.

            Inside this work, these stories, the concepts of unnatural and
            abnormal stop being useful. The unturbid current that must be other
            people’s consciousness challenges my notion of even what is human,
            and yet our absolutely alien mental flows (which I converted into
            power to heal myself) freeze, harden, and evaporate, in warmth and
            shock and love and concern, lateral becomings, and other people's
            fears of their own death.
